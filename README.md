# Questionnaires

I'm updating some of the questionnaires we have used in Helsinki when working in Komi and Karelia, and within this task I'll also publish their templates here so that they can be better reused by others. This said, questionnaire design is very complex task in itself, and one goal here is to evoke some conversation about the ways how we structure what we invariably end up calling a "semi-structured interview".

I'm also designing a questionnaire that could be used to get information about current legal changes in Komi Republic. This will also be added here.

Also here the questions that are used could be classified, up to a certain point, as being part of the same "question concept". Of course in some sense there also have to be some kind of "answer concepts", in case the questionnaire comes with predefined selections for that.
